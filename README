Spreadsheet-WriteExcel-Styler

DESCRIPTION

This is a small utility to help formatting cells while
creating Excel workbooks through the wonderful
L<Spreadsheet::WriteExcel> module.

When working within the Excel application, users often change one
format feature at a time (highlight a row, add a border to a column,
etc.); these changes do not affect other format features (for example
if you change the background color, it does not affect fonts, borders,
or cell alignment).  By contrast, when generating a workbook through
L<Spreadsheet::WriteExcel>, formats express complete sets of features,
and they cannot be combined together. This means that the programmer
has to prepare in advance all formats for all possible combinations of
format features, and has to invent a way of cataloguing those
combinations.

Objects from this module hold a catalogue of I<styles>, where each
style is a collection of format features.  Then, for any combination
of styles, the styler generats a L<Spreadsheet::WriteExcel::Format> 
on the fly, or, if a similar combination was already encountered, 
retrieves the format from its internal cache.
